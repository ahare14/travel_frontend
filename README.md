# Farther - Overview

Farther is an application that enables users to take the next step in planning their travels.  Users are able to take travel inspiration from their fellow friends on Farther. Using the photos / trips of their friends the user can create a list of activities for the location they want to visit.   

Along with getting inspiration from friends, users are also able to provide inspiration by posting their own photos.  With photo posting a user can tie the picture to a location by simply typing the name upon submission.  The location is then queried using google to capture the Latitude and Longitude of the location.

The platform looks to move photos beyond the static level of presentation, but give them functionality.
